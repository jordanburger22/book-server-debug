# Requirements:

Welcome to this debugging assignment! In this task, you'll be working with a Node.js and Express application that interacts with a MongoDB database. Your objective is to clone the repository, identify, and fix the bugs present in the code.

## Instructions:

### **Clone the Repository:**

- Start by cloning the repository to your local machine. Use the following command:
    
    ```bash
    git clonhttps://github.com/jordanburger22/book-server-debug.git
    
    ```
    
- After cloning, navigate into the project directory:
    
    ```bash
    cd book-server-debug
    
    ```
    

### **Remove the Git History:**

- To remove the existing Git history, use the following commands:
    
    ```bash
    rm -rf .git
    
    ```
    

### **Debugging:**

- Carefully review the code to identify and fix any bugs. Utilize the console errors and the debugger in Visual Studio Code to help you locate and resolve issues.
- Avoid using AI services to auto-generate solutions. Instead, focus on developing your debugging skills and problem-solving abilities, which are crucial for growth as a developer.

### **Documentation on `Promise.all`:**

- For a detailed explanation of using `Promise.all` with `async/await`, refer to this [GeeksforGeeks article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/explain-promise-all-with-async-await-in-javascript/). This resource provides a clear overview and examples of how to handle multiple promises with `async/await`.

By following these steps, youâ€™ll gain valuable experience in debugging and enhancing your problem-solving skills. Good luck!
